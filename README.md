 FourIEr phase SepcTrum Analysis - implementation of machine learning

A line profile is interpreted as shifted if all its frequency modes are shifted by the same amount; a line profile is interpreted as deformed if the composing frequency modes are shifted variously. 

We want to use the radial velocities from various regions in the Fourier space to predict stellar jitter.

Inputs are in the fits folder. Replace them if necessary.
